Index sets
----------

* ``y``: technologies
* ``x``: locations
* ``t``: time steps

The default time step length is 1 hour. However, this 1-hourly resolution can be adjusted over parts of the total length of the dataset by using the :class:`~calliope.TimeSummarizer` class (currently, only support for downsampling is implemented).

Technologies
------------

Each node has the following energy balance variables:

* ``s(y, x, t)``: storage level
* ``rs(y, x, t)``: energy resource to storage (+ production, - consumption)
* ``bs(y, x, t)``: backup resource to storage (+ production, - consumption)
* ``es(y, x, t)``: storage to electricity (+ supply, - demand)
* ``os(y, x, t)``: storage to overflow (+ dissipation, - shortfall)
* ``e(y, x, t)``: electricity to grid (+ supply, - demand)

and the following capacity variables:

* ``s_cap(y, x)``: installed storage capacity
* ``r_cap(y, x)``: installed resource to storage conversion capacity
* ``r_area(y, x)``: installed collector area [m2]
* ``e_cap(y, x)``: installed storage to electricity conversion capacity

Internally, the variables ``es_prod(y, x, t)`` and ``es_con(y, x, t)`` are also used for flux from storage to electricity (always > 0), and flux from electricity to storage (always < 0) respectively. This is used to allow formulation of certain linear constraints.

Each technology must define the following parameters, some of which may be zero. By default, all of these are inherited from the default technology definition (with default values being ``0`` for capacities and ``1`` for efficiencies).

* ``r(y, x, t)``: available energy (+ resource, - demand) [kWh/m2 * hour]
* ``s_cap_max(y)``: max storage size [kWh]
* ``s_loss(y)``: storage loss rate [hour^-1]
* ``s_init(y)``: initial storage [kWh]
* ``r_area_max(y)``: maximum collector area [m2]
* ``r_eff(y)``: conversion efficiency [unitless]
* ``rs_eff(y)``: conversion efficiency (backup primary source) [unitless]
* ``r_cap_max(y)``: maximum conversion [kW]
* ``e_eff(y)``: conversion efficiency [unitless]
* ``e_cap_max(y)``: maximum installed storage âŸ· electricity conversion capacity [kW]

Backup primary energy source
============================

Basic support is implemented for a backup primary energy source to deliver energy to storage alongside the primary energy source (``r``). Currently this is only used to provide heat to CSP plants during the ``startup_time`` defined in ``model_settings.yaml``.

This makes use of the following additional parameters:

* ``b(y, x, t)``: available energy (backup primary source) [kWh/hour]
* ``b_max(y)``: maximum conversion (backup primary source) [kW]
