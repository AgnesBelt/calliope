* **Technology**: a technology that produces, consumes, converts or transports energy
* **Location**: a site which can contain multiple technologies and which may contain other locations for energy balancing purposes
* **Node**: a combination of technology and location resulting in specific energy balance equations (:ref:`see below <node_energy_balance>`)
* **Resource**: a source or sink of energy that can (or must) be used by a technology to introduce into or remove energy from the system

Index sets

* ``y``: technologies
* ``x``: locations
* ``t``: time steps
* ``k``: cost classes

For example, the output of the technology ``tech`` at location ``loc`` which outputs energy in the form of ``electricity`` at time ``0`` would be ``e(electricity, tech, loc, 0)``.

Node energy balance
-------------------

Each node, that is, combination of location and technology, has the following energy balance variables:

* ``s(y, x, t)``: storage level
* ``rs(y, x, t)``: energy resource to storage (+ production, - consumption)
* ``bs(y, x, t)``: backup resource to storage (+ production, - consumption)
* ``es(y, x, t)``: storage to electricity (+ supply, - demand)
* ``os(y, x, t)``: storage to overflow (+ dissipation, - shortfall)
* ``e(y, x, t)``: electricity to grid (+ supply, - demand)

and the following capacity variables:

* ``s_cap(y, x)``: installed storage capacity
* ``r_cap(y, x)``: installed resource to storage conversion capacity
* ``r_area(y, x)``: installed collector area [m2]
* ``e_cap(y, x)``: installed storage to electricity conversion capacity

Internally, the variables ``es_prod(y, x, t)`` and ``es_con(y, x, t)`` are also used for flux from storage to electricity (always > 0), and flux from electricity to storage (always < 0) respectively. This is used to allow formulation of certain linear constraints.

Each technology must define the following parameters, some of which may be zero. By default, all of these are inherited from the default technology definition (with default values being ``0`` for capacities and ``1`` for efficiencies). Some of these may be overridden on a per-location basis (see :doc:`configuration`).

* ``r(y, x, t)``: available energy (+ resource, - demand) [kWh/m2 * hour]
* ``s_cap_max(y)``: max storage size [kWh]
* ``s_loss(y)``: storage loss rate [hour^-1]
* ``s_init(y)``: initial storage [kWh]
* ``r_area_max(y)``: maximum collector area [m2]
* ``r_eff(y)``: conversion efficiency [unitless]
* ``rs_eff(y)``: conversion efficiency (backup primary source) [unitless]
* ``r_cap_max(y)``: maximum conversion [kW]
* ``e_eff(y)``: conversion efficiency [unitless]
* ``e_cap_max(y)``: maximum installed storage âŸ· electricity conversion capacity [kW]

Backup primary energy source
============================

Basic support is implemented for a backup primary energy source to deliver energy to storage alongside the primary energy source (``r``). Currently this is only used to provide heat to CSP plants during the ``startup_time`` defined in the model settings.

This makes use of the following additional parameters:

* ``b(y, x, t)``: available energy (backup primary source) [kWh/hour]
* ``b_max(y)``: maximum conversion (backup primary source) [kW]

------------
Cost classes
------------

The primary cost class is ``monetary``, which is used to calculate levelized costs and by default enters into the objective function. Therefore each technology should define at least one type of ``monetary`` cost.

The ``emissions`` cost class allows emissions accounting.

Other cost classes can easily be added to account for additional positive or negative effects of technologies or e.g. break up emissions into more detailed components.
