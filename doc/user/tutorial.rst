========

Before going through this tutorial, it is recommended to have a brief look at the :doc:`components section <components>` to become familiar with the terminology and modeling approach used.

The tutorial is based on the built-in example model and explains the key steps necessary to set up and run a simple model. Refer to the other parts of the documentation for more detailed information on configuring and running more complex models.

TO BE ADDED

.. TODO

.. Note::

   Calliope includes a command-line tool, ``calliope new``, which will create a new model based on the built-in example model at the given path, e.g.::

      calliope new models/my_new_model

   This makes it easier to quickly create a new model based on an existing skeleton.
