# SOLVER AND DEBUG OPTIONS
#

solver: gurobi  # Calliope has been tested with cplex, gurobi, glpk

# solver_options:
    # emphasis_memory: 'yes'  # Set to 'yes' to conserve memory where possible
    # workmem: 1000  # Allow CPLEX use to 1000 MB of memory
    # threads: 1

debug:
    keepfiles: false  # Keep temporary files, useful to examine models for problems
    symbolic_solver_labels: false  # If false, Pyomo does not generate human-readable expressions, so to successfully debug a model, this should be set to true (which is slower, thus off by default)
