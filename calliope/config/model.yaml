# ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS

# Python statements to evaluate before loading additional_constraints
# Can be used to import additional constraint modules
constraints_pre_load:

# List of additional constraints to load
# e.g. constraints: ['constraints.ramping.ramping_rate']
constraints:

#
# GENERAL MODEL SETTINGS
#

# General parameters
startup_time: 12  # Length of startup period (during which some constraints are relaxed) [h]
# TODO change this to 'edge_period' and apply it similarly to end of optimized time series?

# Operation mode settings
opmode:
    horizon: 48  # Optimization period length [hours]
    window: 24  # Operation period length [hours]
